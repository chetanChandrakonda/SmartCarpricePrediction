Smart-Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Models

Overview

Smart Car Price Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning Models is an interactive web application that predicts the price of used cars based on various car features. This project uses machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Regressor to analyze the input data and provide an estimated price for the car.

The app is built using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and Scikit-learn for machine learning. The user can input car features like vehicle age, mileage, engine capacity, and more, to get the car price prediction instantly.

Approach

Data Processing

Import and Concatenate Datasets:

Import all city's car datasets in an unstructured format.
Convert the unstructured data into a structured format.
Add a new column named City and assign values for all rows with the respective city's name.
Concatenate all datasets into a single, consolidated dataset.
Handling Missing Values:

Identify missing values in the dataset.
For numerical columns, fill missing values using mean, median, or mode imputation.
For categorical columns, use mode imputation or introduce a new category for missing values.
Standardizing Data Formats:

Check data types of all columns.
Clean string data where necessary (e.g., remove units like "kms" from the mileage column and convert them into integers).
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Convert categorical variables into numerical values using encoding techniques:
One-hot encoding for nominal categorical variables.
Label encoding or ordinal encoding for ordinal categorical variables.
Normalizing Numerical Features:

Scale numerical features between 0 and 1 for necessary algorithms (Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling).
Removing Outliers:

Identify and remove outliers using methods like Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-score analysis to prevent skewed results.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to understand data distribution.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and correlations using:
Scatter plots, histograms, and box plots for data distribution.
Correlation heatmaps to identify feature relationships.
Feature Selection:

Identify significant features that influence car prices using techniques like:
Correlation analysis.
Feature importance from models (e.g., Random Forest).
Domain knowledge.
Model Development

Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (common ratios: 70-30 or 80-20).
Model Selection:

Choose machine learning algorithms for price prediction:
Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, etc.
Model Training:

Train selected models on the training data.
Use cross-validation to ensure robust performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Tune model parameters to improve performance using:
Grid Search or Random Search techniques.
Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics:

Evaluate model performance using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
Model Comparison:

Compare the performance of different models based on evaluation metrics to select the best performing model.
Optimization

Feature Engineering:

Modify and create new features based on exploratory data analysis insights and domain knowledge.
Regularization:

Apply regularization techniques like Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
Deployment

Streamlit Application:

Deploy the final trained model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application for car price predictions.
User Interface Design:

Ensure the application is user-friendly and intuitive:
Provide clear input fields for users to enter car features.
Display real-time predictions based on user input.
Handle errors gracefully and provide instructions.
